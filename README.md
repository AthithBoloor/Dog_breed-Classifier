## Dog_breed-Classifier
Dog breed classifier using pytorch (Udacity project)

Developing an algorithm that will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed for a given image. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 

# Detect humans
Using OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images.Also testing it on Dog images

# Detect Dogs
Use a pre-trained VGG16 Net to find the predicted class for a given image: dog_detector function returns True if a dog is detected in an image and False if not.

# Build a CNN from scatch to classify Dog Breeds
Build a CNN from scratch to achieve a test accuracy over 10%

# Transfer learning for Dog Breed classification
Create a model architecture that uses a part of a pre-trained model to achieve a test accuracy of over 60%
